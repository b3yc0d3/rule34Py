## [unreleased] - 2025-08-31

### Changed
 - Switched from front-end API url to *official* REST API url for autocompletion.
 - Updated documentation for `rule34Py.autocomplete`
 - Updated unit tests
 - Changed `API_URLS.AUTOCOMPLETE` to semi official endpoint

## [4.0.0] - 2025-08-31

### Added
 - Added a `rule34Py.autocomplete` method.
 - Added `AutocompleteTag` class.
 - Added parameter to `rule34Py.search` method for excluding ai generated content.
 	- Added unit test

### Changed
 - Updated API wrapper to support websiteâ€™s new authentication system.
 - The underlying website API now **requires authentication** (`api_key` and `user_id`) for all requests.
 - Updated unit tests.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added

- Added captcha-compliance capabilities. You can now pass the client your captcha clearance token by completing the captcha in your browser, opening the response header, and writing your `cf_clearance` token into the client's `rule34Py.captcha_clearance` attribute and setting the client's `user_agent` attribute to match your browser.
	- Alternatively, set your execution environment's `R34_CAPTCHA_CLEARANCE` and `R34_USER_AGENT` variables to the appropriate values. The client will read form them during initialization.
	- See [this user guide](https://b3yc0d3.github.io/rule34Py/guides/captcha-clearance.html) for more information. (#24)
- Added a rate limiter for requests to the rule34.xxx base site (the PHP endpoint). By default, the client will now limit API calls that use this endpoint to 1 per second.
	- This behavior can be disabled by setting `rule34Py.set_base_site_rate_limit(False)`.
	- There is no rate limit on the api.rule34.xxx endpoint, which is assumed to handle rate-limiting on the server-side.
	- This new feature requires the `requests-ratelimiter` module.
- Added project documentation via sphinx docs. See: https://b3yc0d3.github.io/rule34Py/. It can be built by calling `make html`. (#24)

### Changed

- Changed the behavior of the `rule34Py.random_post()` method to function more like the website. The method now accepts no `tag` parameters, and returns a random post ID from all posts on the site. Users who want to use the old behavior of returning a random post from the first 1000 tag-search results are directed to do something like `random.choice(rule34Py.search([tags...]))`.
- Changed the `rule34Py.get_pool()` method to return a `Pool` object containing more complete information about a Pool.
	- The Pool's post ids can be accessed via the `Pool.posts` attribute.
- Moved the `:examples/` python recipes into tutorial documentation in the new sphinx documentation (`:docs/tutorials`). (#24)

### Deprecated

- Deprecated support for python runtimes 3.5 to 3.8, as they are EOL. The minimum supported python version is now 3.9. (#27)

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated `legacy.setup.py` file. Users are instructed to upgrade their setuptools installation and use `pyproject.toml` to build the project.
- Removed the `debug.py` file. Users are instructed to use the `make check` Makefile target to run the project's test suite. (#27)

### Fixed
### Security



## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-31

### Added

- Added a `rule34Py.iter_search()` method that returns a Post search iterator that transparently handles pagination. (#20)
- Added a `rule34Py._get()` method to handle HTTP GET requests from the servers. This logic was previously duplicated within most of the client's methods. (#20)
- Added a `rule34Py.tag_map()` method which parses and returns the top 100 global tags (that was previously being returned from the `tagmap()` method.) (#20)
- Added a `rule34Py.top_tags()` method, that parses the global Top-100 tags from the toptags page (like the deprecated `tagmap()` method.) (#20)
- Added a `rule34Py.user_agent` class variable, that users can change to modify the client's User-Agent. (#20)

### Changed

- Began migrating the client's User-Agent string into a client-scope variable (from the module), so that users can alter it if they wish.
- `rule34Py` no longer inherits from the `Exception` class.

### Deprecated

- Announced deprecation of the `rule34Py.rule34Py.version` property. Users should check the value of the module-scope `rule34Py.version` variable instead.  (#20)
- Announced deprecation of the `rule34Py.rule34Py.tagmap()` method. Users should either call `rule34Py.top_tags()` to continue getting the Top-100 tags chart, or `rule34Py.tag_map()` to get the new Tag Map data points.  (#20)

### Removed

- Removed the `deleted` and `ignore_max_limit` parameters from the `rule34Py.search()` method. Neither worked and only ever returned an exception. (#20)
- Removed the `limit` parameter from the `rule34Py.icame()` method, as it did nothing. Users are directed to use list slicing instead. (#20)
